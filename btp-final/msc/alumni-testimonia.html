                        experiment technique, computer programming, different research areas, and a little bit of
                        teaching experience as a teacher assistant. Two years at LNMIIT have been a wonderful experience
                        of learning with prolific exposure to the outside.
                        Huge respect, love and devotion for entire faculty members and department. I always appreciate

                        one's growth both as academician and a researcher. At times seminars have been conducted by the
                        department in which our professors as well as researchers and professors of most prestigious
                        colleges in the country and abroad come and present the talk which gives motivation and idea of

                        top in mathematics.<br />
                        Not only is the infrastructure, placements, library, cafeteria excellent, but the academic staff
                        and group of faculty are supportive, guiding, and practical in nature.<br />
                        And while here we learned that "Thinking is more important than reading."<br />
                        Another additional point which I would like to add is that after doing masters from here, if you
                        go to higher education, then you will get a lot of benefits because here starting from the very
                        basic, the syllabus of NET / GATE - JRF is included in the curriculum. Along with doing all the
                        subjects are taught from standard books so that the fundamentals can be better along with the
                        entrance exam.<br />
                        Despite my background in engineering, I never felt uncomfortable with Mathematics.</p>

The Kazakhstan internship is something I can't not mention! It is one indelible experience that I will probably cherish whole of my life.

Best thing about LNMIIT is that you live with your colleagues, seniors and most of the facilities at the campus itself for 4 years. You can learn a lot with the experience of your seniors and faculties.</td>

From the wealth of knowledge, I gained in the classrooms, to the character development in the hostels, every day at LNM helped me be a better version of myself.

LNMIIT is among those rare institutions - where you don't just find Professors but Mentors; where you don't just find Seniors but Role Models; and where you don't just find Classmates but Confidants.

I am proud to be a part of the LNMIIT family and thankful for that fortune day in 2010 when I decided to associate myself with this wonderful institution.</td>

That is when I fell in love with the beautiful campus and world class facilities. When I joined the college then, were a small family of 500 LNMIITians, everyone knew each other which helped me feel comfortable even though I was living away from home for the first time. I joined LNMIIT for pursuing my interests in Computer Science and I was not disappointed. We had wonderful teachers and a great batch of talented students who were pushing each other to learn more.

At LNMIIT, I was able to indulge in all my hobbies like badminton, dance, chess and even walk the ramp for a fashion show. I was part of the first team to perform at a dance competition outside our own college. Later on I became the coordinator for the Dance Club as well which helped me a lot in learning important life lessons apart for academics.

I was lucky enough to get placed in a "dream" company, Samsung Research Institute, as part of the campus placement, which set me up to pursuit a Master's degree in Computer Science Stony Brook University in New York. Today, while I'm working as a Software Engineer at the Microsoft Headquarters in Redmond, I am thankful for all the things I learned at LNMIIT and the friends that I met there will always be part of my life.

LNMIIT is not just a college it is a way of life that and I will always cherish it.</td>
