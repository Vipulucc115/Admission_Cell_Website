                    <h4>Manager, Content & Ops Glance (InMobi)</h4>
                    <p>Today when I am asked everyday why I am not intimated by challenges and how do I keep my
                        positivity in
                        every situation, I only smile at the questions and say that I owe it all to my alma mater -
                        LNMIIT. I can't
                        elaborate enough on how the right balance of rigorous courses and extra curricular activities at
                        LNMIIT
                        helped me become an all rounder. The Kazakhstan internship is something I can't not mention! It
                        is one
                        indelible experience that I will probably cherish whole of my life. My days at LNMIIT were the
                        best days of
                        my life, no grandiloquence here! Even the recollection of LNMIIT memories will continue to make
                        me smile
                        forever.</p>

                    <h4>Co-founder & CEO EventGraphia, India</h4>
                    <p>I took admission at LNMIIT in 2013 as an aspiring engineer and after 4 years I left LNMIIT as a
                        startup
                        founder. Fun Fact: When I have joined LNMIIT, I didn't even know the meaning of
                        entrepreneurship! I would
                        like to quote this, "You should not go to college for degree, you should go to college to build
                        your
                        career." That's why I love LNMIIT. Here, I got chance to explore a lot of things. Photography
                        was my hobby
                        and with LNMIIT Photography Club, I started pursuing it. In 3rd year, I clubbed knowledge of
                        Photography +
                        Computer Science (my branch), and started EventGraphia along with my colleague Palansh. Best
                        thing about
                        LNMIIT is that you live with your colleagues, seniors and most of the facilities at the campus
                        itself for 4
                        years. You can learn a lot with the experience of your seniors and faculties.</p>

                    <h4>SDE2, Amazon, Seattle</h4>
                    <p>It wouldn't be an understatement to say that my four years at LNMIIT were among the best
                        experiences of my
                        life. From the wealth of knowledge, I gained in the classrooms, to the character development in
                        the hostels,
                        every day at LNM helped me be a better version of myself. LNMIIT is among those rare
                        institutions - where
                        you don't just find Professors but Mentors; where you don't just find Seniors but Role Models;
                        and where you
                        don't just find Classmates but Confidants. I am proud to be a part of the LNMIIT family and
                        thankful for
                        that fortune day in 2010 when I decided to associate myself with this wonderful institution.</p>

                    <p>My life at LNMIIT was a roller coaster. When I left college, I didn't know I will miss it so
                        much..be it
                        the beautiful and soothing campus, friends, professors, sports events , vivacity and many more.
                        The
                        countless nights when we didn't sleep be it before the exam to just doing nothing or before a
                        match will
                        remain in my memories forever. The overall contribution of LNMIIT in shaping my life and overall
                        personality
                        is immense. As Sachin Tendulkar says, ' Enjoy the game and chase your dreams because dreams do

                    <h4>Software Engineer 2 Microsoft (Redmond, Washington, USA)</h4>
                    <p>It feels like yesterday but it was way back in August of 2008 when I first entered through the
                        gates of
                        LNMIIT. That is when I fell in love with the beautiful campus and world class facilities. When I
                        joined the
                        college then, were a small family of 500 LNMIITians, everyone knew each other which helped me
                        feel
                        comfortable even though I was living away from home for the first time. I joined LNMIIT for
                        pursuing my
                        interests in Computer Science and I was not disappointed. We had wonderful teachers and a great
                        batch of
                        talented students who were pushing each other to learn more. At LNMIIT, I was able to indulge in
                        all my
                        hobbies like badminton, dance, chess and even walk the ramp for a fashion show.</p>
                    <p>I was part of the first team to perform at a dance competition outside our own college. Later on
                        I became
                        the coordinator for the Dance Club as well which helped me a lot in learning important life
                        lessons apart
                        for academics. I was lucky enough to get placed in a "dream" company, Samsung Research
                        Institute, as part of
                        the campus placement, which set me up to pursuit a Master's degree in Computer Science Stony
                        Brook
                        University in New York. Today, while I'm working as a Software Engineer at the Microsoft
                        Headquarters in
                        Redmond, I am thankful for all the things I learned at LNMIIT and the friends that I met there
                        will always
                        be part of my life. LNMIIT is not just a college it is a way of life that and I will always
                        cherish it.</p>

                    <p>I’ve been very lucky to be LNMIIT’s Alumni. The grooming, exposure, learning, flexibility and
                        overall
                        environment I got at my college was the breeding ground for my startup and the number one and
                        the biggest
                        factor that’s positively contributed to my career. My startup’s “headquarters” for the first two
                        years was
                        at Boys Hall 2, room A112 :) LNMIIT, in my opinion, gets the best of both the worlds - the best
                        in class
                        faculty, like that a government university with world class infrastructure of a private
                        university.</p>

                    <p>LNMIIT was not a college for me, it was an experience. Other than learning engineering related
                        stuff, I got
                        life experiences which I will never forget. 6 years down the line I might not remember all the
                        courses I
                        did. But, I remember every single experience I had. I remember the late night assignments. I
                        remember how to
                        work on a project with someone I don't like. My suggestion for others is "When you feel like
                        quitting, which
                        you will - Don't quit right now, Quit tomorrow."</p>

The grooming, exposure, learning, flexibility and overall environment I got at my college was the breeding ground for my startup and the number one and the biggest factor that’s positively contributed to my career. My startup’s “headquarters” for the first two years was at Boys Hall 2, room A112 :)

LNMIIT, in my opinion, gets the best of both the worlds - the best in class faculty, like that a government university with world class infrastructure of a private university.</td>

The  faulty, curriculum, infrastructure and culture help you learn the way of living. Your 4 years of life in LNMIIT will help you realise what  you are capable of and how to dream big. </td>

Other than learning engineering related stuff, I got life experiences which I will never forget. 6 years down the line I might not remember all the courses I did. But, I remember every single experience I had. I remember the late night assignments. I remember how to work on a project with someone I don't like. My suggestion for others is "When you feel like quitting, which you will - Don't quit right now, Quit tomorrow."</td>
